EHRI_EAD.odd is the place where the EHRI_EAD schema in maintained.

It is used to genreate a RelaxNG file with embedded schematron rules (EHRI_EAD.rng) and HTML documentation (EHRI_EAD.html)

To generate these files, you can use the OxGarage conversion tool at http://www.tei-c.org/ege-webclient/, selecting the following parameters:
* "Convert from" -> ODD document
* "Convert to" -> RELAX NG schema AND xHTML (You have to run the conversion twice)
